# ELE00102M :: Physical Modelling Synthesis 2020/21
Final Mark for Assessment: 81 %
## Coursework Assessment infomation: 
You  have  been  asked  to  prepare  a  set  of  sound  design  examples  based  on  a Physics  Inspired  or Spectral  sound  synthesis  model.  The  results  are  to  be  presented  online  in  a  website  article  that demonstrates your sound design and sound modelling skills. You are required to submit the following: 
- A  no  more  than  2000-word  website  article,  complete  with  word-count,  using  any  web-authoring package  you  feel  is  appropriate  to  present  your  work.  Whatever  tools  you  use,  the  whole  article should be downloadable for offline reading and make excellent use of audio and images to evidence and demonstrate your understanding of the sound modelling and design process.
- Your MATLAB (or PD or other alternative if you prefer) code with example default parameters to allow the reader to explore the range of sounds you are able to produce.
